# @lumelabs/eslint-react

Opinionated ESLint configuration for **TypeScript + React** projects.

This preset is designed for modern setups using TypeScript, React, Vite/Webpack, and Prettier.
It prioritizes practical correctness over strict ideology and avoids rules that tend to create noise
or force unnatural code patterns.

---

## Features

- ESLint **8.x** only (fully bundled, no peer dependency juggling)
- TypeScript-first (no JS-only compromises)
- React + React Hooks + JSX a11y included
- Prettier-compatible
- Sensible defaults based on real-world usage, not theory
- No legacy or deprecated ESLint patterns
